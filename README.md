Cloud Drive Protocol
 
Inspired by Google Drive (GDrive), we developed a Cloud Drive that allows the user to have his/her files automatically backed up on the cloud and synchronized across several devices. 
 
#Download
 
If the client wants to download a file, then the header will be as the following:
 
download[one space][file name][Line Feed]
Upon receiving this header, the server searches for the specified file.
 
If the file is not found, then the server shall reply with a header as the following:
NOT[one space]FOUND[Line Feed]
If the file is found, then the server shall reply
with a header as the following:
OK[one space][file size][Line Feed]
followed by the bytes of the file
    
#  Upload
 
If the client wants to upload a file, then the header will be as the following:
 
upload[one space][file name][one space][file size][Line Feed]
After sending the header, the client shall send the bytes of the file
 
#  List 
If the client wants to show the list of the available files locally(ll) or remotely(lr) :


#List on the client side (local):
No header needed because we show only the list of files locally without making any request to the  server.
â€¢	List on server side (remote):
In this case the header will be as following :
list[one space][Line Feed]
then the server shall reply with a header as the following:
OK[one space][File Name 1][one space][File Name 2][one space][...][File Name N][one space][END][one space][Line Feed] and if there are no files to list then the server shall reply with a header as the following:
OK[one space][END][one space][Line Feed]

Note: The current version of list function in this protocol doesn't support file names with spaces, an updated version that supports filenames with spaces will be available soon 

 
#Backup
If the client wants to perform a backup of his local repository to  the server:
 This operation is based on the previous C/S communications (local-list and upload) : first we list all the locally stored files and then we make an upload for each local file based on the  upload function that we already have.



# Synchronization
If the client wants to perform a synchronization between all his devices :
 This operation is based on the previous communications (remote-list and download) :  First we make a list call to the server to get the list of  file names on the server, then we perform  a download operation  for each file name from the list that we got using the download function that we already have.
